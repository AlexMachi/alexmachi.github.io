## Active Directory Project Overview
---
In this guide, we will walk through the steps to set up a homelab that includes an Active Directory, a domain user, a Splunk server, and a penetration testing system using Kali Linux.

We will explore the workings of a domain environment by configuring a domain controller, adding a domain user, and creating group policies. Additionally, we will simulate a brute-force attack to generate telemetry, which will be ingested and analyzed using Splunk and Sysmon.

This setup will be achieved on a single Windows computer by utilizing VirtualBox to create a virtual environment for the homelab.

## Hardware Requirements
---
* Windows OS
* 16GB RAM
* 256GB Disk Space

## Active Directory Project (Part 1) Objectives
