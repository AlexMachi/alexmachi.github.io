# Welcome

I'll guide you through the steps of setting up an Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux & Atomic Red Team. Explore how a domain environment works, learn how to ingest events to a SIEM and generate telemetry related to attacks seen in the wild to help you detect them in the future. If you are new to cybersecurity or IT, you don't want to miss out on this project.

## Hardware
